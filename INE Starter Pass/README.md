## Solve

The challenge presents a message related to the [INE](https://checkout.ine.com) company. Given the previous info only one person solved it until the challenge's name was change and it was given a new website link. The name was changed to INE (Starter Pass) where it hints to a more particular part of the INE's online presence and the new link [INE Starter Pass](https://checkout.ine.com/starter-pass) confirms it.

In the previous link presented if we inspect the elements we can see a div called "register__analytics". Inside of that div there are more nested divs until we find a paragraph <p> and a <span> and finally inside of that span we see the flag, in a way.

We can see that the string ```ZmxhZ3syOWZhMzA1YWFmNWUwMWU5ZWRjZjAxNDJlNGRkY2RiOX0=``` isn't in the normal flag{...} format, but we can also see that the string ends with an "=". Maybe base64? By using an online base64 decoder we confirm our assumption, it is base 64.

Flag was ```flag{29fa305aaf5e01e9edcf0142e4ddcdb9}```
