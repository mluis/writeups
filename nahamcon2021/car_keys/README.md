We found this note on someone's key chain! It reads... ygqa{6y980e0101e8qq361977eqe06508q3rt}?
There was another key that was engraved with the word QWERTY, too...

## Solve

They say that another key was engraved with the word "QWERTY" which intuitively leads to "QWERTY" being some sort of decoding key.

Given the flag, we perform an Alphabetical Substitution in which the chipertext alphabet is "QWERTY".

Flag was `flag{6f980c0101c8aa361977cac06508a3de}`
