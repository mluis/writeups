```
Brad wanted to send a msg to Raj but he wanted to hide it from his wife? Can you help Raj decode it?
Hint: Brad sought for help from his friend Allan Latham, and he received a software for it in Jan 1999
```

For this challenge we were provided with an [image](HIDDEN_INSIDE_3.jpg) to analyse.

Investigating the hint we found a [software](http://io.acad.athabascau.ca/~grizzlie/Comp607/programs.htm). Using [JPHS](http://io.acad.athabascau.ca/~grizzlie/Comp607/programs.htm) we can try to get the hidden file and the flag is written to file without the need of a password.
