For this challenge we were provided with a [url](http://3.142.122.1:8889/) to visit.

Visting the webpage and trying a standard login we receive a message with the mention of a possible username.

Seeing that the message was client-sided i took a look at the source code. I found a javascript file and a function named `checkIt()` being run when using the login button.

When looking at the `checkIt()` function i found a hashed password.

 I entered it on crackstation and got a result.

After that i used it to log in and a file was downloaded containing the flag.
